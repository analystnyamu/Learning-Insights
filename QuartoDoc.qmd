# Quarto Documents

Quarto documents are used for dynamic reporting, data analysis, and creating reproducible research. They are similar to R Markdown files but offer enhanced features and support for multiple programming languages, including R, Python, and Julia.

## Key Features of Quarto Documents

- **Markdown Support**: Quarto uses Markdown syntax for formatting text.
- **Code Chunks**: You can include code from R, Python, or other languages, with output displayed inline or as separate results.
- **Multi-Format Output**: You can render Quarto documents to various formats, including HTML, PDF, and Word.
- **Narrative Text**: Use plain text formatted with Markdown for headings, lists, links, images, etc.
- **Embedded Outputs**: Results from code chunks, like tables and plots, are embedded directly in the document.
- **Cross-references**: Quarto supports cross-referencing figures, tables, and sections, enhancing document structure.

## How to Use Quarto Documents

### Step 1: Install Quarto
- Download and install Quarto from the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).
- If you use RStudio, update it to the latest version for compatibility.

### Step 2: Create a New Quarto Document

1. **In RStudio**:
   - Go to **File > New File > Quarto Document**.
   - Choose a template if prompted, and save the file with a **.qmd** extension.

2. **Using the Command Line**:
   - Run the following command to create a new Quarto file:

     ```
     quarto create my_document.qmd
     ```

### Step 3: Write Your Quarto Document

- **Header**: At the top of the document, specify metadata in YAML format:

## Narrative Text

Use Markdown to format your text, as shown below:

```
## Introduction

This is a simple Quarto document. You can use **bold** text, *italic* text, and create lists:

- Item 1
- Item 2
```

-   **Code Chunks**: Insert code chunks with the following syntax:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
# R code example
#summary(cars)
```



```{python}
# Python code goes here
#import numpy as np
#np.random.rand(5)
```

**Step 4: Render the Document**

To render the document into the desired output format (HTML, PDF, etc.), use the following command in the terminal or RStudio:

```
quarto render my_document.qmd --to html
```

If you want to open the rendered document immediately, use:

```
quarto render my_document.qmd --to html --open
```

# Additional Tips

-   **Customize Your Document**: You can customize the appearance and layout of your Quarto documents using themes and templates. Refer to the [Quarto documentation](%5Bhttps://quarto.org/) for more details.

-   **Use Code Folding**: Consider enabling code folding for long code chunks to make your document cleaner and more navigable.

-   **Leverage Quarto's Features**: Take advantage of features like cross-references and citations to create a more dynamic and interconnected document.

-   **Publishing**: Quarto supports publishing documents directly to platforms like GitHub Pages or RStudio Connect.

-   **Version Control**: Integrate Quarto documents with Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
