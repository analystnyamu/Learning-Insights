## Use of Python Code in Quarto Document

To use Python code in a Quarto document, you can embed Python code chunks in your `.qmd` file. Quarto supports several programming languages, including Python, and allows you to execute code in the document, similar to how `Jupyter Notebooks` work.

Here’s how to include and run Python code in a Quarto document.

## Steps To Follow

1. **Install Required Tools**

*   Make sure you have **Python** installed.

*   Install **Jupyter** if you haven't already, as Quarto uses Jupyter to execute Python code.

You can install Jupyter using the following command:

```{bash}
pip install jupyter
```

2. **Set up Quarto**

*   Install Quarto if you haven't done so. You can download and install it from [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/)

3. **Write Python Code in Quarto Document**

In your Quarto document `(.qmd)`, you can include Python code chunks by specifying `{python}` at the start of the chunk.

# Python Example in Quarto

Here’s a simple Python example embedded in a Quarto document.

```{python}
# Python code
import numpy as np

# Generate random numbers
random_numbers = np.random.rand(5)
random_numbers
```

```{yaml}

### 4. Render the Quarto Document

You can render the Quarto document using:

- In the terminal: 

quarto render your_document.qmd
```

*   In Visual Studio Code or RStudio: Use the **Render** button if you are working with these editors.
The output will include both the code and its result in the specified format (HTML, PDF, etc.).

5. **Output Formats**

Quarto supports various output formats (e.g., HTML, PDF, MS Word). Specify the format in the YAML header at the top of your .qmd file:

```{yaml}
---
title: "Python Example in Quarto"
format: 
  html: default
  pdf: default
---
```

# Using Python in Quarto

You can run Python code directly within Quarto documents.

```{python}
# Import the necessary library
import numpy as np

# Generate 10 random numbers
random_numbers = np.random.rand(10)
random_numbers
```

The output of the Python code will be rendered inline in your document.

### 6. Additional Tips
- **Code Chunk Options**: You can control the output behavior of Python code chunks using options like `echo`, `eval`, `include`, and `results`.
  - `echo`: Whether to show the code in the output (`true` or `false`).
  - `eval`: Whether to evaluate the code chunk (`true` or `false`).
  - `results`: How to display the results (`"asis"` for raw output, `"hide"` to hide results).

Example:
```{python, echo=true, eval=true, results="asis"}
print("This is a Python print statement")
```
